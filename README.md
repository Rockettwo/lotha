## Getting Started

This application uses Flutter. 
For help getting started with Flutter, view their 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

To use the services of [OxfordDictionaries](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/) 
for this application you need a special business or research plan, because
this application is saving content. Of course it would work with the Developer
plan, but according to 6.1.2 of the Terms and Conditions this is not allowed.

When you have your API credentials, you copy the file /lib/ApiCredentials__.dart to
/lib/ApiCredentials.dart and insert your credentials.
